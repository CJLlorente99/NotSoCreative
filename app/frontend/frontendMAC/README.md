````
3. Open a terminal in the same folder where _frontendMAC.py_, _frontendMACpython.sh_, 
_googleStorageAPI_, _installPackage.py_ and _png.png_. Write the following command in the terminal.
````commandline
sh ./frontendMACpython3.sh

# Trobleshooting
If you already had a Python distribution installed in your computer and you have not installed
the most recent one, it is possible that the installation fails.

If this is the case, check you indeed have a Python distribution via writing the following command in the console.

````commandline
python --version
````

If you get a result with the version number. Then you can try the following command, after you have
positioned yourself in the folder described in the step **3**.

````commandline
sh ./frontendMACpython.sh
````

It is important to note that executing the frontend with Python old distributions can result
in further errors. Consider update your actual Python distribution.
